# Makefile Skill

GNU Make build automation guidance for modern development workflows.

## What This Skill Provides

- **Core Syntax Reference** - Rules, prerequisites, targets, variables
- **Function Reference** - Built-in text and file name functions
- **Pattern Rules** - Implicit rules and pattern matching
- **Practical Patterns** - Ready-to-use recipes for common tasks

## Quick Start

See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for core concepts and quick reference.
