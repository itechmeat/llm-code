# PicoClaw

PicoClaw is an ultra-lightweight AI assistant written in Go. This skill is a practical operator playbook for running the CLI, configuring `~/.picoclaw/config.json`, and operating `gateway` + channels.

## Quick navigation

- Getting started + common commands: `references/quickstart.md`
- Config (`model_list`, tools, gateway, channels): `references/config.md`
- Tools (web search, exec guardrails, registries): `references/tools.md`
- Auth flows (OpenAI OAuth, Google Antigravity OAuth, token): `references/auth.md`
- Gateway operations (health/ready, cron, heartbeat, voice): `references/gateway.md`
- Channels (Telegram/Discord/WeCom/OneBot/etc): `references/channels.md`
- Skills management (install/list/remove, registries): `references/skills.md`
- Cron scheduling via CLI: `references/cron.md`
- Migration notes: `references/migration.md`
- Troubleshooting: `references/troubleshooting.md`

## When to use

Use when you need to:

- Bootstrap PicoClaw on a host (onboard → config → run)
- Switch providers/models via `model_list`
- Run the agent in CLI mode or operate `gateway`
- Enable chat channels (Telegram/Discord/Slack/WeCom/...)
- Configure tools (web search, exec deny patterns, skills registries)
- Install/remove skills into the workspace
- Schedule recurring jobs (cron)

## Recipes

### 1) Initialize + verify

- Create initial config and workspace templates:
  - `picoclaw onboard`
- Verify what’s configured:
  - `picoclaw status`

### 2) Chat from CLI

- One-shot:
  - `picoclaw agent -m "Hello"`
- Interactive:
  - `picoclaw agent`

### 3) Run gateway (channels + cron + health)

- Start gateway:
  - `picoclaw gateway`
- Debug logs:
  - `picoclaw gateway --debug`

### 4) Manage auth

- OpenAI OAuth (optionally device-code for headless):
  - `picoclaw auth login --provider openai`
  - `picoclaw auth login --provider openai --device-code`
- Google Antigravity OAuth:
  - `picoclaw auth login --provider google-antigravity`
- Check status / list models:
  - `picoclaw auth status`
  - `picoclaw auth models`

### 5) Install skills

- List installed skills:
  - `picoclaw skills list`
- Install from GitHub repo slug:
  - `picoclaw skills install sipeed/picoclaw-skills/weather`
- Install from registry:
  - `picoclaw skills install --registry clawhub github`

### 6) Add a scheduled job

- Create a cron job:
  - `picoclaw cron add --name "Daily report" --cron "0 9 * * *" --message "Summarize my inbox"`
- List jobs:
  - `picoclaw cron list`

## Critical safety notes

- Do not commit real API keys or OAuth tokens into a repo; keep them in `~/.picoclaw/` only.
- Be cautious enabling the exec tool; keep deny patterns enabled unless you fully trust the environment.
- Exposing gateway to `0.0.0.0` makes health endpoints reachable from the network; do that only intentionally.
