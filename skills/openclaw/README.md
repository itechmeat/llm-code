## What this skill provides

- Fast routing across architecture, tools, gateway, onboarding, channels/providers, nodes, and troubleshooting.
- Practical operational guardrails (auth, pairing, remote access, tool policies, incident triage).
- Consolidated references from one-page-at-a-time ingestion workflow.

## Key files
